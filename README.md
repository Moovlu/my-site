# My Personal Site
A website I've created entirely from scratch. The live version of this site is hosted on [Neocities](https://moovlu.neocities.org/) while the development version is hosted here on [GitHub Pages](https://moovlu.github.io/my-site/).

I want to ensure as much as possible on this site is created by me. That means:
- Every line of code is written by me
- Every asset is made by me or referenced in the code and credits page

Any instance of something not created by me will be attributed inside of the credits page.

> [!NOTE]
> If I accidentally miss a reference to any material, please create a GitHub issue or contact me.
